# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide for SmartTest Arena

## 📋 Overview

This guide will help you deploy the enhanced SmartTest Arena platform to Railway, making it accessible on the internet.

## 🎯 What We're Deploying

- **Enhanced FastAPI Backend** (`enhanced_server.py`)
- **Interactive Quiz System** with CAT Grade 11 questions
- **Analytics Dashboard** with real-time performance tracking
- **Subject Management System** for curriculum organization
- **Modern UI/UX** with responsive design

## 📦 Prerequisites

1. **Railway Account**: Sign up at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. **Railway CLI**: Install with `npm install -g @railway/cli`
3. **Git Repository**: Your project should be in a Git repository

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Your Project

Your project is already prepared with:
- ✅ `Procfile` - Points to `enhanced_server.py`
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - All necessary dependencies
- ✅ `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- ✅ Enhanced server with Railway compatibility

### Step 2: Login to Railway

```bash
railway login
```

### Step 3: Initialize Railway Project

```bash
railway init
```

This will:
- Create a new Railway project
- Connect your local repository to Railway
- Set up deployment configuration

### Step 4: Add PostgreSQL Database

```bash
railway add
```

Select "PostgreSQL" from the options. This will:
- Create a PostgreSQL database
- Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable automatically

### Step 5: Deploy Your Application

```bash
railway up
```

This will:
- Build your application
- Install dependencies
- Start the server
- Make it available on the internet

### Step 6: Get Your URL

```bash
railway domain
```

This will show you the public URL where your application is accessible.

## 🔧 Environment Variables

Railway automatically sets these environment variables:
- `PORT` - The port your application should listen on
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
